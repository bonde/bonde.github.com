I have a bachelor's degree from [The Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Copenhagen](http://diku.dk)
where I am currently studying for my master's degree. I have followed the
courses from the [COME](http://come.ku.dk/) competence profile
[Computational and Mathematical Modeling](http://diku.dk/english/Studyprogrammes/uddannelse03/curriculum_csm/)
and will start writing my thesis in spring 2012.

My main interest lies within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which will also
be the subject for my thesis. During my studies I have worked with different
methods including SPH and FVM. I have experience with building a simulator from
scratch as well as using with the open source CFD toolbox
[OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.com).

During studies, part-time jobs and spare time projects I have experience with a
wide array of programming languages and paradigms.  I have a general interest in
open source software and have been using Linux-based operating systems on a
daily basis since 2006.

In my spare time I enjoy playing music and hacking on whatever project I might
have going. Currently I am into the Python web framework
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com).

You can also stalk me on either [Google+](http://profiles.google.com/ulrikbonde)
or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ulrik.bonde), get a hint of my musical
preferences and general mood on [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/ulrik_polak),
check out which job I recently quited at
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ulrikbonde) and finally have a look at
some random projects here at [GitHub](http://github.com/bonde/).
