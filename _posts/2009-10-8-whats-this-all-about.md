title: What's this all about?
tags: [me, git, bachelor project]
excerpt: Hi! My name is Ulrik Bonde and I am studying at
"The Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Copenhagen":http://diku.dk
where I plan on finishing my bachelor's degree this year.  I am currently in the process
of writing my bachelor project, in which we would like to find out whether you
can use techniques from computer vision to determine if a painting exhibits
artistic use of the golden ratio.
This involves some feature detection using the open source computer vision
library from Intel called "OpenCV":http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ . The
code is primarily written in Python using bindings supplied by OpenCV. The
program code and report are hosted here on github but be warned, the report is
written in danish. Check the repository out at
"http://github.com/thorlund/gyldnesnit":http://github.com/thorlund/gyldnesnit.

Hi! My name is Ulrik Bonde and I am studying at
[The Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Copenhagen](http://diku.dk)
where I plan on finishing my bachelor's degree this year.  I am currently in the process
of writing my bachelor project, in which we would like to find out whether you
can use techniques from computer vision to determine if a painting exhibits
artistic use of [the golden ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).
This involves some feature detection using the open source computer vision
library from Intel called [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/). The
code is primarily written in Python using bindings supplied by OpenCV. The
program code and report are hosted here on github but be warned, the report is
written in danish. Check the repository out at <http://github.com/thorlund/gyldnesnit>.

It was in the start-up of the bachelor project that I became aware of this
fantastic site called github and the possibility of hosting my webpage here.
I was planning on setting up my own server, but stumbling across
[ahf's](http://www.0x90.dk/) personal blog I discovered
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and found it to be exactly what I was looking
for.  I am not a web designer and this solution allows me to focus on the content
of the site rather than fighting html.  I'm not saying that the contents of this
page are great, just that I'm happy not having to worry too much about the
layout.

One of the reasons for wanting a webpage was for me to make my various papers
from my studies available for others to see.  The combination of github, i.e.
[git](http://git-scm.com), in combination with Jekyll is perfect for this.
Furthermore I plan on uploading my configuration files, thus being able to have
the same preferences at different machines. Until now my workflow regarding
configurations have been really stupid and inefficient to say the least.  I am
also looking forward to just pointing people to my git repository instead of
mailing them dotfiles and "R'ingTFM" out loud for them.  Also, knowing that my
various files will now soon be public, I have taken the time to tidy them up a
bit.  I'm pretty happy with the results.

Now I was saying that I would like to make my papers available. Although I plan
to upload everything from my computer science studies, I do not plan on making
all of it public the reason being not everything I touch turn to gold (it mostly
turn to feces). That's why I am also considering an investment in private
repositories here at github. Hopefully that will allow me to keep my
self-respect, yet still have all of my early monkey-code available to myself.

Finally I needed someplace to supply my [public key](/key/). It will also soon be
available at a keyserver near you.

Well, theres more to come and way too many other things to be done. I'd better
get back to work. There's no real reason to "stay tuned" as future posts
probably will concern linux, open source and pseudo-random everyday "stuff"
lacking real substance...
