I've finally pulled myself together and made a repository on GitHub with my
configuration files. I've just doubled checked them for any personal info that
might have been and they're clean. But there you go. I've provided my vimrc
which is a hybrid of my old config from Gentoo and various elements from
[ahf's vimrc](http://github.com/ahf/ahf-vim). The tab-completion is pure genius. My
long time zshrc is also in the repository. It corrects typos.  I still have yet
to find out whether zsh correcting my typing errors is a good thing. Probably
not. Finally there's my mutt configuration files.  I just recently started using
mutt as I really needed something that could provide different profiles
depending on the receiver. Gmail's interface, though pretty neat, just didn't
cut it. I found a reasonable solution by sourcing different files with headers
and signatures by using folder hooks. It gets the job done and it sorta work :)
Anyways, here's the repository:
