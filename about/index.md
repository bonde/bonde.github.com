My name is Ulrik Bonde and I am a bachelor student at
[The Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Copenhagen](http://diku.dk).

This site offers a scary amount of insight to my everyday life. You can see how
pissed I was last weekend on [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ulrik.bonde),
get a hint of my musical preferences and genreal mood on
[last.fm](http://last.fm/user/ulrik_polak), check out which job I recently
quited at [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ulrikbonde) and finally have a
look at what I'am *really* doing here at [GitHub](http://github.com/bonde/).

### My troublesome childhood

I've always been somewhat fascinated by computers. I remember playing Frogger on
our old Atari, making an old telvision emitting permanent racing car-sounds
because of playing to much PitStop, old fashion 'copy-paste' of several hundred
lines of code to have the printer hooked up to the Commodore 128 print out an
UFO and spending too much time playing Monkey Island on the Amiga. We also had a
PC, an IBM of some sort, and the same old 'clikety-click'-keyboard still serves
me to this day.

I don't think I was allowed to play computer all day. My mother insisted that my
eyes would turn rectangular by looking at the TV for too long and I believed
her. I was sent outside to play, even on rainy days. Now seems like a good time
to reveal that I was raised on the countryside in [Snekkerup][snekkerup]
with 11 kilometers to the closest major city, [Slagelse][slagelse].

At some time I decided that I was gonna play music and I wanted to play the
bass. Living in relatively isolated place provided good conditions for
practicing undisturbed.

### Recap

From this introduction we can conclude that I am a very dull, pityfull existence with
a serious deficiency regarding humor and social skills. I have a serious problem
with irony which is why you now are wondering what to make of this text...
