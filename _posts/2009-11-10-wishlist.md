With my birthday and Christmas coming up in just a month we enter the time where
people start bugging me for my wish list. Those days are thankfully over now. No
longer can relatives, nor friends, accuse me for not providing them with a list
of things not yet in my inventory, as I will now keep an updated list on Github.
The list is written in Danish but the book titles should be readable by anyone
:) Check it out here: [Wish list (pdf)](http://github.com/bonde/wishlist/raw/master/oensker.pdf)
